Is there anything that needs to be pulled out for further discussion council? All those in favor? Carried for zero. Next we have the Manitoba Arts Culture and Sport and Community Fund. Colleen, can you just explain what this is first? So this is we require a resolution from council as part of the arts culture and sport and community fund grant application. So we are putting forward the Springfield Recreation Center. We do have money committed in the financial plan for 2022. And part of that application we do have to show that the RM is putting in or has some money committed to the project. I know Sean is online. I don't know if there's anything else he wants to add but. No that's perfect. I just wanted to make sure the constituency understands why we're applying for this and why it's reflected in the budget. So that was a great bit of information you gave. Can I have a move in a second or please? Councillor Raulke. Councillor Fuehl. Be it resolved that the RM is Springfield submit the Springfield Community Recreation Center project for grant funding through the Manitoba Arts Culture and Sport and Community Fund and be it further resolved that the Council of the RM is Springfield supports the project and commits to provide $9,508,226 towards the project. Thank you. Is there any further discussion from Council? Councillor Fuehl. Yeah I have a couple of questions for Mr. Wilkinson. For this grant my questions are this is for the full project. I know we talked about doing this even in phases or the build could be done in phases. And I'm just wondering like you know through these economic times is any consideration of at least putting in for the first phase or can we like how does this application work? I guess I need some more understanding. Yeah no for sure. This application we're going to submit for the full project costing which is just around $18 million. So if we don't get the full amount if they give us less then we would contribute less and we would just again piece can we piece together what we want to build in the first phase then. Yeah 100% we can do that. Okay because that's my concern is that we know we get X amount but it doesn't surprise the two thirds let's say or that percentage can we scale it back and then it will still get that money or will they pull it away? Well no I mean it's 50% for the total project cost so yeah I mean we're going in for the full amount which is $5 million. It's up to the problems of we're going to get that 5 million I mean we go and full project cost and they give us 3 million I'm not sure how they're going to evaluate the project yet. That's a new program and the evaluation criteria from my understanding is yet to be determined but for this application process we will go in for full project costing. Okay thank you for that clarification no problem. Thank you is there any other questions from council? All those in favor? Opposed? So is that carried 3-1? No. That's carried 4-0. 4-0 sorry your hand was late Councillor Fuele I apologize with the internet connection. Carried 4-0. Next we have the cancellation of receivables.

Thank you is there any further discussion from council? All those in favor? Carried 4-0. Next we have ward appropriations. So I think council most of us have some ward appropriations left. I had a couple to bring forward just to let you know about Cook's Creek Community Club is fundraising for they're doing some sort of a covering over their arena. So they're looking for some funding for that and the daycare in dogold is fundraising for some playground equipment. So I wanted to let you know about that as well. I feel like there's one more and I can't remember what it is right now. But those two so I don't know if we want to put a motion through today or do it all next week on our last like our before we have to spend all our ward appropriation money on the next council meeting. So do we want to wait till next next council meeting to finish off council? I had given Colleen my arrest my appropriate ward appropriation of the balance going to the food bank. Oh okay is there anybody else that's interested? Otherwise I'm I can put it through I have a little bit left I believe that I'm going to put to these two projects. Can you have any idea of how much I have left a council or Dean? Are you speaking to Colleen first or do you want me to either whichever works so go ahead while Colleen looks that up. I was just going to I've given something to Colleen already just prior to the meeting here and also maybe I will do 500 to Cook's Creek and 500 to which was the other one that you mentioned. The dogold take care. The spring field learning center was what is that the same as I gave before then for the meeting. Okay. So I talked to Leola at the daycare and do well they're fundraising for daycare equipment outside playground. So I would do 500 for that 504 Cook's Creek and 500 for Springfield learning center. Yes. And I will do 750 for each Colleen. Of the ones you spoke of right mayor. Yes. Okay. Yep. And I'll wait for Colleen to finish. Do we have another request councilor Rocky? I was doing 500 to and I'll look at the community club and 250 to 4 H and I'll do with the ones that were just mentioned. 250 to Cook's Creek and 300 to the playground equipment for the dogold take care. I should be almost done or my remainder maybe do that because it should be minimal at that point. And you know what you can add 500 to the Noa community club because it's them I spoke to I think needed some funding. Actually do 750 for all three Colleen to make it simple. Thank you. And can I have a move on a seconder for that council? Councilor Rocky councilor Dean. Here is all the council of the arm of Springfield approved the following more to preparations. For the mayor 750 dollars to Cook's Creek community center 750 to do well daycare and 750 to a Noa community club. Ward 1 619 dollars and 50 cents to the Springfield Food Bank.

Ward 4 500 dollars to a Noa community club 250 to the 4 H club 250 to Cook's Creek community club and the remaining funds to the dogold daycare. Perfect. Thank you councilor Verdun.
