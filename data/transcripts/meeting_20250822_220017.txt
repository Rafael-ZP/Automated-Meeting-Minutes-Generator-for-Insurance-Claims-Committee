 Hello friends, I am Jagdish Prasad and you are watching your channel Quality Perfect India. Welcome everyone to this channel. Today's topic is very important topic which is Minutes of Meeting, that is MOM. In today's agenda we will talk about what is MOM, why we do MOM, how we do MOM, what is the format of MOM and how we will show you practically by taking an example how we study MOM format. Let's start. But before starting this session, I want to give you an information that this channel is called Quality Perfect India. I try to tell you in detail all technical videos on this channel but in this best of our life, every person does not have enough time to see detailed videos. We have made a technical channel for a short video called QPI Sorts. If you do not get much time, then you can go to QPI Sorts channel and you will find many small videos there. You can get knowledge by watching them. Friends, I will request you that the way you have supported Quality Perfect India, similarly you will also support QPI Sorts channel and you will subscribe it. Friends, let's start the session. MOM is the full format of Minutes of Meeting. It seems like we will count the meeting in minutes but friends, it does not happen. In MOM, you need not watch the second video if you get clear. First, what, second why and third how. What is MOM? Why do we do MOM and how do we do MOM? Let's try to understand these three things. First, we talk about what is MOM. If we talk about the definition, then what is the definition? Minutes of meeting are notes that are recorded during meeting. Meaning, whatever we do during meeting, whatever point is discussed, we fill up the notes in a format. And whatever members are in the meeting, we sign up. We do MOM, that is Minutes of Meeting. Now let's talk about why we do MOM. There are many reasons to do MOM but if you remember 5 reasons, then why do you do MOM? This will be a clear concept. What are the 5 reasons? First, it is accountability of each member. The accountability of each member, the responsibility of each member, is to decide which work to do. Second benefit is that if any member is absent in that meeting, then they will find out what was discussed in the meeting. Third benefit is that it is evident from discussion that this is the point discussed in this meeting. Fourth is that whatever minute meeting is made between supplier and customer, then the proposed action that is made by them is targeted by MOM. The fifth important thing is historical record. We keep it as a record, as evidence, in which date, in which meeting, whatever point is discussed, we keep it as a historical record. So these are the 5 benefits if we do MOM. Now let's talk about the third thing, how. There is a person who is a key person in any meeting. For those key persons, 3 things are necessary. One is before meeting, second is during meeting and third is after meeting. What do we do in the before meeting? First of all, we should understand the objective, to understand who is going to have a meeting. Second is to prepare the agenda, to create the agenda. What is the point to discuss? First of all, you should prepare as an agenda. For example, if a customer comes to the supplier, then first of all, think about discussing at what point, if we have to do QA, if we have to do audit, then what we have to check in the audit, what check points should be made, if there is any quality problem, then we will go there and check. Or everything comes in the agenda. That is, before the meeting, the agenda is fixed, whatever is the key person. And third thing is, if you are a key person, then you should sit with a diary and a pen in the meeting, in which whatever point is discussed, we can note it. During the meeting, if you are a key person in the meeting, then you need to do two things. First is, when the meeting is taking place, you have to carefully listen to each and every thing, which member is discussing what points. And the second thing is to write that point in your diary, that what is the point of discussion between each person. These are two things to do. Now let's talk about what should be done after the meeting. After the meeting, when the meeting is over, then whatever you have noted in the diary, whatever point you have written, in the MOM format, that is the format of the minutes of the meeting, you have to write it in a point-proper way. The second thing is that whatever is your senior or the one in whose meeting is taking place, you have to review it by writing a point that there is no point in it. Third thing is that whoever is present there, you have to sign up from them, whether it is a tendency or in the MOM format, by writing a name and signing up from them. Fourth point is to circulate the MOM. That is, when the sign up is done, when the expenses are finalized, then you have to circulate the MOM through email or in a hard copy. Fifth is to put this MOM in a file or you can scan it and keep it in a computer so that it is clear in the future that at what point, which person was present and the meeting was done. The fifth thing is to do the meeting after the meeting and whatever date you have got according to that, you have to follow it accordingly to close the points. So, before the meeting, during the meeting and after the meeting, what should a key person do? I hope you have understood these three things. Let's talk about the MOM format. What should be the point or element in that format? First, the name of the organization, the logo of the organization, and then in the heading, you should write minutes of meetings, the location, the date and time should be written, and the member should be present in the meeting. After that, whatever point is discussed, the point should be written properly. After that, what is the proposed action against that point? It should be written. After that, what point should be done? It should be a responsibility. After that, how long should the target date be? After that, after signing up the prepared and reviewed by, or a format is taken. Friends, whatever point we have discussed, it may not be clear concept, so I am showing you a format practically, what is there in the format. Let's see how the format is. Let's talk about how the format should be blank. It is a simple format and you can follow this format. But there is no hard and fast rule that you follow this format. You can make the format according to your organization. I am trying to show you a standard format. In this format, you should have the name of the organization in the middle. As we have written the name of the organization here, you should have the company logo on the left side. After that, you should have the name of the organization in the bottom. You should have the meeting heading on the right side. You should have the date, location, time, and whatever details you want to give, it is important to be in every MOM. Now let's talk about members present. If your meeting is taking place between a customer and supplier, then you should have the name of the customer and supplier. You should have the name of the customer and supplier. After that, you should have the sign up column. After that, you should have the purpose of meeting in the bottom. You should have the meeting in the bottom. After that, you should have the serial number, the address, the responsibility, the target date, and the remark. You should have the sign of the prepared and reviewed person in the bottom. This is a standard format that you can follow. Let's take a practical example. Let's talk about how we will fill the format in that practical example. Let's talk about how we will fill the format. There are two types of meetings. Either there is a customer and supplier in every industry. If there is a quality problem, or an audit, or a QA, then you should have the minutes of meeting, that is MOM. The second slightly changes if you are having a board meeting or a big meeting, with a lot of 30-40 members present, then the format is separated by the member. Let's talk about how a customer and a supplier have meetings. We will talk about that in an example. We have taken an example, that a supplier is giving a plastic part to his customer, but when he goes to the customer, then it is difficult to fit in here. The part of the lower case is made of plastic, and a hole is made of plastic, and a fly has come in the hole, which is not fit. To take this and meet, the customer A has come to the supplier B. Let's see how it is done. First of all, the name of the organization is ABC. Write down the organization, the logo, the ABC, and the minutes of meeting, and the date is 18-24, you can put in the date, the time is 10 am, you can put in the location, you can put in the location. In the member present, we have taken the customer A, you can write the customer's name, and in that, the name of the customer is Amit, and in the next, you have to sign up, and the supplier B, whose name is Ram Siam Ghanshiam, write down the name, and sign up. The subject is, quality problem in plastic part, lower case model XYZ, meaning the model XYZ, has a quality problem in its plastic part, and this is being met for this. In the serial number 1, point discussed, is that the entire area of the lower case model XYZ, and due to this flash, that part is not fit in the customer end. This is the point discussed. Now what is the action on this? In the action, it is written that, verified and found that mold punch wear out, or due to mold punch wear out, flash generated in the hole, and now what to do? Punch will be rectified, meaning we will rectify the punch, and the punch was pulled, and the flash was generated in the hole, and now we will rectify the punch, and the second punch will be placed, and this is being proposed on the action. Who will do the responsibility? Ram, the supplier, is the window person, when will the target date be? 28-24th, and what is written in the remark? After tool rectification, the sample will be submitted to customer for fitment checking, meaning to do fitment checking, on 28th, the supplier will send you a sample to the customer, to check, and the minute is submitted, and the prepared by Sumita and the reviewed by Amit, is the format of the MOM. If there is any other point, then you can write in point 1, 2, 3, and below, we have only one point here to explain you. So friends, we have come to understand the practical example, how we keep on increasing the format of MOM. Friends, how did you like the video?
