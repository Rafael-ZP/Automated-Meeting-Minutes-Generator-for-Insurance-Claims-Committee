Here are the Minutes of Meeting (MoM) for the Insurance Claims Committee meeting:

**Agenda**

* Introduction to the course on data science for engineers
* Objectives and expectations of the course
* Overview of the course structure and content

**Discussions**

* The course is designed for beginners in data analysis and will cover the fundamentals of data science, including linear algebra, statistics, and optimization.
* The course will use R as the programming language and will focus on the mathematical side of data analytics.
* The course will not cover big data concepts such as map-reduce and Hadoop frameworks.
* The course will cover a few machine learning techniques that are relevant for beginners and will emphasize the importance of assumption validation.

**Decisions Taken**

* The course will be taught in a structured approach, with a focus on explaining concepts in terms of data science problems and providing a framework for understanding different data analysis problems and algorithms.
* The course will use R as the programming platform, but will not be an in-depth R programming course.
* The course will cover the fundamentals of data science, including linear algebra, statistics, and optimization, and will provide a comprehensive understanding of data analysis problems and solutions.

**Action Items**

* Participants are expected to stick with the course and complete all assignments to get the most out of the course.
* Participants are expected to learn the fundamentals of data science and get a fundamental grounding on important ideas and math that they need to learn to understand data science.
* Participants are expected to be able to describe data analysis problems in a structured framework, identify comprehensive solution strategies, classify and recognize different types of data analysis problems, and determine appropriate techniques.
